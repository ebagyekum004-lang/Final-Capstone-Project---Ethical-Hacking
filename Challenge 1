# Final Capstone Project

## Challenge 1: SQL Injection

This repository documents the successful identification and exploitation of a **SQL Injection vulnerability** within an authorized lab environment as part of the **Cisco Networking Academy Ethical Hacking Final Capstone Project**.

The objective of this challenge was to enumerate user account information from a vulnerable web application, recover and crack Bob Smith’s account credentials, and use those credentials to access a protected system and retrieve the Challenge 1 code.

All actions were conducted **strictly within scope**, under an approved **Pentesting Agreement**, and for **educational purposes only**.

---

## Objectives

The objectives of this challenge were to:

* Identify and exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability
* Enumerate database information and user credentials
* Crack a recovered password hash
* Use valid credentials to access a remote system
* Locate and retrieve the Challenge 1 code
* Propose effective SQL Injection remediation techniques

---

## Lab Environment

* **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux
* **Vulnerable Web Application:** DVWA
* **DVWA Server IP:** 10.5.5.12
* **Target System IP:** 192.168.0.10
* **Database Type:** MySQL
* **Attack Type:** SQL Injection (Union-based)

---

## Tools Used

* Web Browser
* DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
* SQL Injection payloads (manual input)
* Password hash cracking tool
* SSH
* Nmap

---

## Methodology & Results

### Step 1: Initial Setup and DVWA Configuration

The DVWA web application was accessed via a browser at:

```
http://10.5.5.12
```

The application was accessed using the default credentials:

* **Username:** admin
* **Password:** password

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

```markdown
![DVWA Login Page](images/dvwa_login.png)
```

After logging in, the DVWA security level was configured to **Low**:

* Navigate to **DVWA Security**
* Select **Low**
* Click **Submit**

At this security level, input sanitization is disabled, making the application vulnerable to SQL Injection.

```markdown
![DVWA Security Level Low](images/dvwa_security_low.png)
```

---

### Step 2: SQL Injection and Database Enumeration

The **SQL Injection** module was selected from the DVWA menu. The application presented a vulnerable input field labeled **User ID**.

```markdown

```

Initial testing confirmed the presence of a SQL Injection vulnerability when crafted input altered application behavior.

### Database Identification

The database name was successfully identified using a UNION-based SQL Injection technique.

```

---

### Table and Column Enumeration

The database schema was enumerated to identify tables containing authentication data. The `users` table was identified as containing usernames and password hashes.

Column enumeration revealed fields related to usernames and passwords.

![Column Enumeration](images/column_enum.png)
```

---

### Credential Extraction

Usernames and password hashes were successfully retrieved from the `users` table, including **Bob Smith’s account**.

```

---

### Step 3: Password Hash Cracking

Bob Smith’s password hash was extracted and cracked using a password-cracking tool.

**Result:**
Bob Smith’s plaintext password was successfully recovered.

**Screenshot Placeholders:**

```markdown

![Password Cracked](images/password_cracked.png)
```

---

### Step 4: Accessing the Target System

Using the recovered credentials, an SSH connection was established to the target system:

```
ssh smithy@192.168.0.10
```

A port scan confirmed that SSH was available on the target system.

**Screenshot Placeholders:**

```markdown
![Nmap Scan](images/nmap_ssh.png)
![SSH Login](images/ssh_login.png)
```

---

### Step 5: Locating the Challenge 1 Code

After logging in, directory contents were enumerated to locate the challenge file. The file containing the Challenge 1 code was identified and opened.

**Result:**
The file displayed the Challenge 1 flag/code.

```markdown

```

---

## Findings

* DVWA was vulnerable to SQL Injection at low security
* Improper input handling allowed full database enumeration
* User credentials were exposed and password hashes recovered
* Weak passwords enabled successful cracking
* Compromised credentials allowed unauthorized system access

---

## Remediation: Preventing SQL Injection Attacks

The following remediation techniques are recommended to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities:

1. **Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)**
2. **Principle of Least Privilege** for database accounts
3. **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization**
4. **Use of Stored Procedures**
5. **Secure Error Handling and Logging**

---

## Ethical Considerations

All activities were conducted:

* Within an **authorized Cisco NetAcad lab**
* Under a signed **Pentesting Agreement**
* For **educational and defensive purposes only**
* Without targeting real-world systems or users

Unauthorized SQL Injection attacks are illegal and unethical.

---

## Reflection

This challenge demonstrated how a single input validation flaw can lead to complete system compromise. The exercise reinforced the importance of secure coding practices and proactive vulnerability testing to protect applications from real-world attacks.
